    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
      dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants
      belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with
      brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal
      levels of salt, yeast and sugar.

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      As legend has it, the croissant was invented as a special roll in Vienna
      to celebrate the end of its invasion by Turkish troops from the Ottoman
      Empire in 1683. The enemy decided to attack at night to avoid being seen,
      but the Viennese bakers, who were working at the time, realized the city
      was under siege and alerted the authorities.
